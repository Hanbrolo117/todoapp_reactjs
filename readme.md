<h3>Simple Non-Persistent React JS Todo App</h3>
<hr/>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<br/>
<p>The goal of this simple application was to develop a React JS project to completion and to gain a core understanding of how React JS works.</p>
<br/>
<p>With the developed knowledge, the next step is to translate this understanding to build the same app using, instead, the Dart over_react library. By doing so, an understanding of the terminology and functions in over_react can be better understood and will hopefully enable me to pick it up more quickly as over_react is built atop React JS.</p>
